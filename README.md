# Recruitix Live Integrity System

## A Parameterized and Deterministic Framework for Robust AI-Driven Assessment and Integrity Validation

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Recruitix** is an AI-driven online assessment and proctoring platform designed to ensure **fairness**, **reproducibility**, and **integrity** in remote evaluations.

Unlike traditional AI-based testing systems that rely on random logic or opaque algorithms, Recruitix introduces a **deterministic**, **parameterized**, and **auditable** framework for technical, HR, and live interview assessments.

The system combines **semantic grading**, **behavioral simulation**, and **live integrity monitoring** to create a transparent, explainable, and ethical AI evaluation environment.

Recruitix can be used by **academic institutions**, **corporate recruiters**, and **certification agencies** for secure, large-scale, and unbiased assessments.

## 🧩 Key Features

* ✅ **Deterministic Evaluation Engine** – Produces identical results for identical inputs, ensuring full reproducibility.
* ✅ **Semantic Similarity Scoring** – Uses Jaccard similarity and keyword weighting for accurate conceptual grading.
* ✅ **HR Simulation Engine** – Implements deterministic behavioral models for candidate profiling.
* ✅ **Parameterized Proctoring System** – Monitors live video and event data to detect integrity violations.
* ✅ **Secure Firebase Backend** – Authentication, real-time database, and safe environment-based credential handling.
* ✅ **Responsive Web Interface** – Developed using React + TypeScript with Framer Motion and Shadcn UI.
* ✅ **Explainable and Auditable AI** – Every score, deduction, and event is logged for transparency.

## 🧬 Python Face Recognition Proctoring Module

Recruitix includes a standalone **Python-based exam proctoring system** (`exam_proctor.py`) that uses real face recognition to verify and continuously monitor student identity during exams.

### How It Works

| Library | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **MediaPipe FaceMesh** | Face presence, face count, head pose estimation (yaw/pitch). Cannot verify identity. |
| **face_recognition (dlib)** | 128-d face embeddings for identity verification against the registered student photo. |
| **OpenCV** | Camera capture, frame processing, and live preview window. |

### Features

* ✅ **Identity Gate** — Student must match their registered photo before the exam can start (30s timeout)
* ✅ **Continuous Identity Re-verification** — Periodically checks that the same person is still at the camera
* ✅ **Face Count Monitoring** — Detects if additional people appear in frame
* ✅ **Head Pose Estimation** — Flags when student looks away (yaw > 30° or pitch > 25°)
* ✅ **Debounced Violation System** — 3 consecutive strikes before confirming a violation
* ✅ **JSONL Violation Log** — Machine-readable log with timestamps and snapshot paths
* ✅ **Frame Snapshots** — Captures the exact frame at the moment of each violation

### Installation

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Windows Note:** `face_recognition` requires **dlib**, which needs **CMake** and a C++ compiler.
> Install CMake first: `pip install cmake`, or use conda:
> ```bash
> conda install -c conda-forge dlib face_recognition
> ```

### Usage

```bash
# Basic usage — verify against student photo and monitor
python exam_proctor.py --reference student_photo.jpg

# Use a specific camera (e.g., external webcam)
python exam_proctor.py --reference student_photo.jpg --camera 1

# Run headless (no preview window)
python exam_proctor.py --reference student_photo.jpg --no-window
```

### Output Files

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `violations.jsonl` | One JSON line per confirmed violation (type, message, timestamp, snapshot path) |
| `snapshots/*.jpg` | Frame captured at the moment of each violation |

### Configuration

Key parameters can be adjusted at the top of `exam_proctor.py`:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `MATCH_TOLERANCE` | 0.55 | Face distance threshold; lower = stricter |
| `IDENTITY_CHECK_EVERY_S` | 8 | Seconds between identity re-checks |
| `PRESENCE_CHECK_EVERY_S` | 1.0 | Seconds between face count / pose checks |
| `STRIKES_TO_VIOLATION` | 3 | Consecutive failures before flagging |
| `MAX_YAW_DEG` | 30 | Max head turn (left/right) in degrees |
| `MAX_PITCH_DEG` | 25 | Max head tilt (up/down) in degrees |
